# Text-ICU: Comprehensive support for string manipulation

This package provides the Data.Text.ICU library, for performing
complex manipulation of Unicode text.  It provides features such as
the following:

* Unicode normalization

* Conversion to and from many common and obscure encodings

* Date and number formatting

* Comparison and collation

# Prerequisites

This library is implemented as bindings to the well-respected [ICU
library](http://www.icu-project.org/) (which is not bundled, and must
be installed separately).


# Compatibility

Upstream ICU occasionally introduces backwards-incompatible API
breaks.  This package tries to stay up to date with upstream, and is
currently more or less in sync with ICU 69.


# Get involved!

Please report bugs via the
[github issue tracker](https://github.com/haskell/text-icu/issues).


# Authors

This library was written by Bryan O'Sullivan.
